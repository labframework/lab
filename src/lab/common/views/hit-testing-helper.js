/**
  Forward mouse events to the view's stack of overlaid visual layers to simulate the "hit
  testing" that would occur natively if the visual layers were all implemented as descendants of
  a single, common svg element.

  In that scenario, native hit-testing is used: a mouse event at any point is forwarded to the
  topmost visible element at that point; the layers above it are effectively transparent to the
  event. This is subject to control by the 'pointer-events' property. See
  http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/interact.html#pointer-processing

  However, in order to allow some layers to be implemented as <canvas> elements (or perhaps
  <divs> or rootmost <svg> elements, to which hardware-accelerated css transforms apply), and to
  allow those layers to be above some layers and below others, our layers cannot in fact be
  children of a common svg element.

  This means that the topmost layer always becomes the target of any mouseevent on the view,
  regardless of whether it has an element at that point, and it hides the event from the layers
  below.

  What we need, therefore, is to simulate svg's hit testing. This can be achieved by listening
  to events that bubble to the topmost layer and successively hiding the layers below, applying
  document.elementFromPoint to determine whether there is an element within that layer at that
  event's coordinates. (Where the layer in question is a <canvas> with its own hit testing
  implemented in Javascript, we must defer to the layer's own hit-testing algorithm instead
  of using elementFromPoint.)

  CSS pointer-events (as distinct from SVG pointer events) cannot completely capture the
  semantics we need because they simply turn pointer "transparency" on or off rather than
  responding to the presence or absence of an element inside the layer at the event coordinates;
  and besides they do not work in IE9 or IE10.

  Note that to the extent we do use CSS pointer-events, document.elementFromPoint correctly
  respects the "none" value.

  What this means for event handling:

    * Mousedown, mouseup, and any custom mouse events such as those created by the jQuery
      ContextMenu plugin, are captured by a click shield element and prevented from bubbling.
      However, a clone event is dispatched to the element that passed the hit test and allowed
      to bubble to the window.

    * Click events on the click shield are captured and canceled because they are inherently not
      meaningful--the browser cannot tell if the mouseup and mousedown targets are "really" the
      same so it dispatches click events anytime a mousedown and mouseup occur on the view.
      Instead, if the mousedown and mouseup occur on the same element or sprite (e.g., same
      atom) we dispatch a synthetic click event targeted at the element. In the case that the
      mouseup occurs on a sprite in the canvas layer, the click event is only emitted if the
      same sprite was under the previous mousedown. Additionally, the target of a click on a
      sprite is the canvas layer itself since to DOM gives us no way to be any more specific.
      (Notice this means the same canvas can successfully hit test a mousedown followed by a
      mouseup, but still not cause a click to be issued, if the mousedown and mouseup were over
      two different sprites.)

    * Canvas elements should not listen for click events. They are responsible instead for
      performing a click action, if appropriate, when they receive a mouseup, and notifying the
      parent whether a DOM click event should be issued. (This prevents them from having to
      hit-test the same coordinates twice, once for the mouseup and then once for a click.)

    * Single-touch containing touch events will be captured and canceled, and synthetic mouse
      events corresponding to the touches will be issued and routed through the above-discussed
      hit test exactly as if they were mouse events. This is a reasonable choice because we do
      not use any multitouch gestures and must retain compatibility with desktop browsers.

    * Note that mouseover/mouseout/mousenter/mouseleave events are not handled in any way!
